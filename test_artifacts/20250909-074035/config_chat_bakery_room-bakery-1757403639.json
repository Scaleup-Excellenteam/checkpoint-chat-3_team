    "user0: Hey, did you try the new sourdough loaf today?",
    "user1: Yes! The crust was greatâ€”how did you tweak the hydration?",
    "user0: I used 80% hydration for that extra chewy texture.",
    "user1: That's a lot of water; I'll have to try that!",
    "user0: I also added a longer bulk fermentation for extra flavor.",
    "user1: How long did the bulk fermentation take, roughly?",
    "user0: About four hours; it depends on your room temperature.",
    "user1: Four hours sounds perfect; I'll aim for that.",
    "user0: What kind of flour works best for that kind of bread?",
    "user1: I usually use a mix of bread flour and whole wheat.",
    "user0: A mix of flours sounds perfect for added nutrients!",
    "user1: I might add some vital wheat gluten for extra strength."
