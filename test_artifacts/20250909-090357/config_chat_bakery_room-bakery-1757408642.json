    "user0: Good morning everyone! Did anyone taste the new sourdough loaf?",
    "user1: Yes! I loved how crispy the crust turned out.",
    "user2: The crumb felt softer too—did you change the hydration level?",
    "user3: I thought it had a slightly nuttier flavor than usual.",
    "user4: That’s probably from the rye flour addition, right?",
    "user5: Exactly, I caught that tangy aftertaste. Really nice balance.",
    "user6: The smell in the bakery this morning was incredible.",
    "user7: Customers kept asking if we had baked something special today.",
    "user8: We should definitely put this version on the weekend menu.",
    "user9: Agreed. Maybe we can pair it with the new strawberry jam?",
    "user10: Or even with the whipped butter we tested last week.",
    "user11: Has anyone tried toasting it yet? It makes amazing bruschetta.",
    "user12: Oh, good idea. Add some olive oil and garlic—perfect!",
    "user13: I’d love to see a seeded version too, maybe pumpkin seeds?",
    "user14: Yes, or a multigrain loaf. Healthier options always sell well.",
    "user15: If we add seeds, we’ll need to adjust the hydration again.",
    "user16: True, but it’s worth experimenting. Customers love variety.",
    "user17: I think we should also try mini sourdough rolls for lunch boxes.",
    "user18: Great point. Kids would love smaller portions like that.",
    "user19: Awesome ideas, everyone. Let’s test a batch tomorrow and share feedback!"
